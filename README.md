# EscapingThroughAKittenBox

In this project, 200 kittens are represented as numbers and the play method the KittenBox class simulates each of 200 kittens moving to a random square until they reach the exit square and escape from the kitten box. So, all 200 kittens move around the KittenBox and escape along the way. The game stops when all the kittens have escaped and it prints out the number of moves it took for all the kittens to escape. The user can change how fast the kittens move, how big they want the KittenBox to be (here it is 8x8 but they can make it bigger than that) and how many kittens they want inside their kittenbox.

Programming Concepts: Multi-dimensional Arrays and Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as encapsulation(each class had its own private instance variables and public/private methods) , abstraction (used a private method called play() in KittenBox class), and inheritance (boxGUI extends JFrame)
